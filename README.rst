.. _installation docs:
   https://pyoath-toolkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html

1. Make sure CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, or PyPy â‰¥ 2.0 is installed.
2. Make sure `pip is installed`_.
3. Make sure ``liboath`` from `oath-toolkit is installed
   <http://nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/download.html>`_.
4. If you're using CPython, it's recommended that a C compiler and Python
   development headers/libraries are available.
5. Run the following:

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      user@host:~$ pip install pyoath-toolkit

.. _pip is installed: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html

Usage
-----

To generate a time-based one-time password (TOTP):

.. code-block:: python

   from oath_toolkit import TOTP
   from time import time

   digits = 6
   time_step = 30
   oath = TOTP(b'secret key', digits, time_step)
   one_time_password = oath.generate(time())

To validate a HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP):

.. code-block:: python

   from oath_toolkit import HOTP
   from oath_toolkit.exc import OATHError

   def verify(otp, counter):
       digits = 6
       oath = HOTP(b'secret key', digits)
       try:
           return oath.verify(otp, counter)
       except OATHError:
           return False

For an explanation of terms like ``time_step`` and ``counter``, refer to the
`API documentation <#documentation>`_.

More complex examples can be found in the ``examples/`` directory, which
includes a port of the command-line app ``oathtool``, a sample Django project,
and a simple Flask app which shows how WTForms integration works.
