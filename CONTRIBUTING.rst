This project is hosted in two places: `GitHub`_ and `Gitorious`_. I accept
pull/merge requests from both services. If you contribute code, please also
create tests for your modifications, otherwise your request will not be
accepted (I will most likely ask you to add tests). It would probably also
be in your best interests to add yourself to the ``CONTRIBUTORS.rst`` file
if you have not done so already.

Gitorious does not seem to provide an issue tracker, so the GitHub `issue
tracker`_ is the only one to use at the moment.
